## I have no idea how to start solving this mission

To get N-th element of an array you can use "array[N]".
[Lists indexes](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists").

## I need some help to proceed with the mission

Don't forget to check is it inside an array.

```python
if N < len(array):
    ...
else:
    return -1
```

## I am gone half way through. Need help!

To calculate a power use the "**" operator.

```python
2 ** 3 == 8
4 ** 4 == 256
```
